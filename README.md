# Voice-assistant

The name of this voice assistant is "Wake".
For this to work one has to have voices installed onto the device. Normally, voices are already installed onto a windows device when installing the language packages for the display and keyboard language.

However, the voices used for this voice assistant are Hedda(German) and Hazel(British English) which can be downloaded from the following link:
